Football Simulator

A C++ simulation of a college football season, designed to generate teams, simulate games, and create a playoff bracket based on performance. Built as a personal project to explore object-oriented programming, data structures, and simulation logic.

🏈 Features

Create custom teams and conferences

Simulate full regular season matchups

Track team records and stats

Generate and simulate a playoff bracket

Determine and declare a national champion

🧠 Learning Goals

Practice C++ object-oriented programming (OOP)

Implement classes, constructors, and data encapsulation

Use vectors and other STL containers

Explore randomness in simulations

Design logic for tournament brackets and progression

🛠️ Tech Stack

C++ – Core simulation logic

Standard Template Library (STL) – For containers and algorithms
